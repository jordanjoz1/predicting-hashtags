0,"<p>I took a java class and a VB class this semester in college. I was able to pass both classes with a low C. It was very difficult for me, and I barely survived the class. I now can read code and can tell you what is going to do and what it is going to print to the screen. However, I still can't write code very well at all. I mean, I can create ints, arrays, strings, and can assign variables, but I still can't write the code from scratch. Any tips? I'm studying information science in college, and I'm going to need to learn this because I'm most likely going to wind up a programmer. </p>

0,"<p>I have to create and retain hundreds of thousands of objects for my app. I've noticed in Chrome that sometimes when I load the page, it will take longer than usual to create the objects even though I have done 0 code changes. Then, after the objects are created, the page will run slower than usual; often times the CPU profiler will either say it's GC or some random function using the majority of the CPU. Like I said, sometimes I'll refresh the page without any code changes at all and I won't see this behavior. The two go hand in hand: if the objects are created slowly for whatever reason, the page WILL run slowly and say it is a random function or GC.</p>

<p>In IE, the page runs as I'd expect it to as usual.</p>

<p>You can't diagnose anything without seeing thousands of lines of code, but does anyone have any ideas for me? Why would Chrome exhibit that behavior? Any easy tweaks I could try? Thanks!</p>

0,"<p>I have 2 forms on the same page. One is called from 'A'. Other one is called form 'B'.</p>

<p>Form A is dynamically loaded with the values getting from a database.</p>

<p>Form B has 56 inputs. Each input of form B has unique ids' which are the values of form A's inputs. Number of inputs </p>

<p>appearing on form 'A' may be different due to client's previous requests.</p>

<p>Form 'A's all inputs have the same name (Aname) but values are different.</p>

<p>Each and every input of form 'A' has a value and also in form 'B' you can find a corresponding input for each value from form </p>

<p>'B'. The css class of the inputs of form 'A', should apply for each corresponding input of form'B'.</p>

<p>The fact is: form A's inputs' values have been printed as the id(s) of each input of form 'B'.</p>

<p>Number of inputs of form B is fixed. That is ""56"".</p>

<p>Number of generated inputs of form A may be different from one user to another. Anyhow the maximum number of inputs of form A is also ""56"".</p>

<p>For example,
enter code here</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name=""A""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""alreadybooked"" value=""2"" disabled=""disabled"" class=""red""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""alreadybooked"" value=""5"" disabled=""disabled"" class=""red""&gt;
&lt;input type=""text"" name=""alreadybooked"" value=""3"" disabled=""disabled"" class=""red""&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;form name=""B""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""0"" class=""btn-submit"" id=""1"" data-assetid=""1""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""0"" class=""btn-submit"" id=""2"" data-assetid=""1""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""0"" class=""btn-submit"" id=""3"" data-assetid=""1""&gt;
   &lt;input type=""button"" value=""0"" class=""btn-submit"" id=""4"" data-assetid=""1""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""button"" value=""0"" class=""btn-submit"" id=""5"" data-assetid=""1""&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Accordingly the example, the css class ""red"" should be applied on form 'B's first, third and fifth inputs.</p>
